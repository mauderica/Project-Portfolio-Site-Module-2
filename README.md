# Project-Portfolio-Site

TODO:

- insert my own images
- add descriptive alt-attributes to each image
- Footer: insert social media icons that are clickable and link to my pages
- make the overall site responsive (so that it looks nice at different sizes --> images, overall layout, text sizes)
- go through project criteria for other to-dos
