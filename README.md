# Project-Portfolio-Site

TODO:

Required:
- logo (put the one I created back or make a fairy one?) [make a logo with CSS SVG, or second pass at logo with CSS, or replace with a fairy silouette, or profile photo?]

In progress:
- go through project criteria for other to-dos
- ensure code passes html and css validators (& pagespeed insights?)
- LAST: format documents and commit that change on its own

May do later:
- [extra: with JS] Edit project link so that when user hovers with mouse over it, a message with the link appears.
- Final pass: make images responsive (so that they look nice at all viewport sizes --> both container size and the position and scale of the image within the container)
- .cover & .cover2 --> consolidated into just .cover for now. Consider putting those styles under main-image and project-image (although that would not be the most concise)? ... Keep both if am thinking of adjusting the positioning of the .cover2 images separately from the .cover ones.
- Fix hyperlink text format so that it doesn't show as underlined but something else (different colour text? or slightly bold? or muted?)
- Find a way to vertical-center the "project-text" more dynamically than with media queries


DONE:

- insert my own images
- add descriptive alt-attributes to each image
- Footer: insert social media icons that are clickable and link to my pages
- make a logo with CSS
- First pass: make the overall site responsive (so that it looks nice at different sizes --> images, overall layout, text sizes)
- Second pass: make the overall site responsive (so that it looks nice at different sizes --> images, overall layout, text sizes)
- fix title and footer responsiveness sizes for 320px-400px viewport width
- create alternate images of different file size and resolution and use <picture> and srcset to give the browser information to choose the appropriate image
- add subcategories to my media queries using comments, for better organization of my CSS
- replace the no-break-spaces in html with css styling --> can be done with a span and margin, but chose not to do at this time.
- fix <h3 class="project-title"> so that the top margin is bigger at the smallest viewport size.
- clean-up and segregate as necessary the use of "title margin" & "text-margin"
