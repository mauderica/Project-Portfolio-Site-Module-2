# Project-Portfolio-Site

TODO:

- Second pass: make the overall site responsive (so that it looks nice at different sizes --> images, overall layout, text sizes)
- go through project criteria for other to-dos
- make a logo with CSS SVG, or second pass at logo with CSS, or replace with a fairy silouette, or profile photo?


DONE:

- insert my own images
- add descriptive alt-attributes to each image
- Footer: insert social media icons that are clickable and link to my pages
- make a logo with CSS
- First pass: make the overall site responsive (so that it looks nice at different sizes --> images, overall layout, text sizes)
