# Project-Portfolio-Site

TODO:

Required:
- logo (put the one I created back or make a fairy one?) [make a logo with CSS SVG, or second pass at logo with CSS, or replace with a fairy silouette, or profile photo?]

- fix <h3 class="project-title"> so that the top margin is bigger at the smallest viewport size.
- Final pass: make images responsive (so that they look nice at all viewport sizes --> both container size and the position and scale of the image within the container)
- go through project criteria for other to-dos
- Edit project link so that when user hovers with mouse over it, a message with the link appears.
- create alternate images of different file size and resolution and use <picture> and srcset to give the browser information to choose the appropriate image
- replace the no-break-spaces in html with css styling
- ensure code passes html and css validators (& pagespeed insights?)


DONE:

- insert my own images
- add descriptive alt-attributes to each image
- Footer: insert social media icons that are clickable and link to my pages
- make a logo with CSS
- First pass: make the overall site responsive (so that it looks nice at different sizes --> images, overall layout, text sizes)
- Second pass: make the overall site responsive (so that it looks nice at different sizes --> images, overall layout, text sizes)
- fix title and footer responsiveness sizes for 320px-400px viewport width
